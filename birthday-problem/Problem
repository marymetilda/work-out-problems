Vonnue is a company that celebrates birthdays by cutting cakes on specific days of each week for all the birthdays happening in that week. The company follows the following rules:

Cake cutting days: Determine the dates when cakes should be cut for birthdays happening in a given week.

1. All Sundays are considered holidays and not suitable for cake cutting.
2. Every month, the second Saturday is considered a holiday.
3. In addition to the fixed holidays, there can be other holidays as well.
4. If it's not possible to find a cake cutting day within a week due to holidays, the cake cutting will be postponed to the next week's last working day.
5. If the next week is also a holiday, the cake cutting will be postponed to the next week's last working day, and so on.

Holidays: Consider the fixed holidays (Sundays and second Saturdays of each month) along with any additional holidays while determining the cake cutting days.

<!--
Write a properly testable code to find out all the cake cutting days given an array of birthdays and a list of holidays, considering the rules mentioned above. Be sure to think about and handle any potential edge cases that may arise during the implementation.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or clarifications! -->
